    <p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</p>
	<p style="font-size:1vw; font-family:verdana">The results given allow me to visualise and understand my personality traits. It gives me an insight into my positive and negative traits. By highlighting my main trait, Campaigner, it allows me to know what my best position would be in a team scenario.</p>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p>
	<p style="font-size:1vw; font-family:verdana">The results from 16Personalities will influence my behaviour in a team as it shows and provides a topic and an explanation of my personality inside the topic. For example, with the 16Personalities test, it shows that I am 91% extraverted. In a team setting, this will make me more of a vocal team member and not afraid to talk and communicate with my peers. </p>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p>
	<p style="font-size:1vw; font-family:verdana">Through the information that this test has informed me of, when making a team, I am more suited to people with a clear mindset and willing to take risks. I work well as a team leader or advocate and can be efficient with the energy I have. </p>

  <div class="column">
    <h2 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">Big 5 Test:</h2>
   <img src="big5.jpg" alt="big5" title="The Big 5 Results">
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</p>
	<p style="font-size:1vw; font-family:verdana">The results in the test provide a brief understanding in the 5 big traits. However accurate these tests are said to be, I disagree with how this test evaluated my answers. Firstly, I believe that the first attribute “extraversion” is wrong as I know that my personality and believe that I am an extraverted person. Also, the test only provides a scale, with no explanation to each trait.</p>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p>
	<p style="font-size:1vw; font-family:verdana">As stated previously, I believe that this will not influence my behaviour in a team as the results I  believe were not accurate. There is no secondary information provided with the graph and no explanation as to what the scale provides, all information that would have to be inferred. </p>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p>
	<p style="font-size:1vw; font-family:verdana">When forming a team, the best paring would be allocating the areas that were states as “low” with pupils that were to be “high” in any given trait. It would also be beneficial to have a mix of pupils with high results to broaden the quality of work. </p>

    <img src="personmax1.jpg" alt="personmax1" title="Personalities Max 1 Results">
	<img src="personmax2.jpg" alt="personmax2" title="Personalities Max 2 Results">
    <p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</p>
	<p style="font-size:1vw; font-family:verdana">The results of the test provide me with the information on how I learn and what aspects of learning I respond best to. From this test, I learnt that I am a Kinesthetic learner. This means I learn by doing. I learn in this manner whenever I capture new information through the process of physical activity. It is often referred to as a hands-on learning experience.</p>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p>
	<p style="font-size:1vw; font-family:verdana">Through this test I have learnt that I am good at learning through hands-on experience, that I like to touch objects and people, would rather participate than watch, that I get satisfaction from building with their hands and enjoy classes with physical experiments. Through this knowledge, I believe that this could affect the enjoyment of a project if I do not get certain wants fulfilled. This test provides me with information that the rest of my group would best delegate tasks that are more so physical as that sits well with my skillset. </p>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p>
	<p style="font-size:1vw; font-family:verdana">When taking this into account, when forming a team, I should be partnered with people that have a strict outline and idea of the project idea and the group goal. In the team, I should be set with a very hands-on roll or important roll to kill my skillset in use. The test shows that I would work well in a group environment.</p>
