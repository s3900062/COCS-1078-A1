<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">A description (in your own words) of the position:</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">The position is Principal Security Consultant at Pure Security, Melbourne VIC. The position available entails penetration testing (testing the security, the ease of hacking) to various platforms such as web, mobile and PC applications and services, external and internal infrastructure evaluation and analysis to find security exploits and vulnerabilities, identify and lead research projects thus developing new security products and service ideas, security code review, reverse engineering, security design and architecture engagements and much more. In brief, this position is to ensure safety of individuals, and as well as large organisations. The role is to protect the public to ensure that applications are safe and have no ways of misuse as well as large organisation’s network and computer infrastructure are not susceptible to hackers attempting to use data for misconduct and wrongdoing. </p>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">What makes this position appealing to me:</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">This position is appealing to me as should I fulfill this position, I will help ensure that the public as well as businesses keep their technology and vital information safe from harm. Also, to this, finding vulnerabilities and exploits in all sorts of applications as well as network/computer infrastructure will ensure I am always on my feet expecting new and clever ways that hackers aim to misuse vital information. I believe this position would be very exciting as no day will be the same due to the rapid growth of technology and the demands of security in the modern-day world. Whilst the monetary value of this position is also a very appealing aspect, the fact and idea of helping people while trying to find any possible way to misuse a piece of software/hardware make this a very appealing job for me.</P>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">	The skills, qualifications and experience required for the position:</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">The skills, qualifications and experience required for this position are as follows, minimum of 8 years’ experience in cybersecurity/penetration testing with a finger on emerging threats, vulnerability exploits and attack vectors, a degree in Technology or a relevant Business discipline or equivalent experience is required, ability to develop and deliver training and/or speaking material for public and/or private events, articulate business implications and accurately calculate risks of findings in relation to the business, develop web and infrastructure exploits for identified vulnerabilities, solid communication skills to work with all stakeholders at various levels with firm but cooperative attitude, strong written skills to clearly explain concepts with accurate grammar, self-driven to progress work tasks in a timely manner, sometime autonomously, but under direction as required, flexibility and motivation to work across application, infrastructure, consulting, and managed services engagements and systems and industry certifications such as CREST, OSCP, OSCE highly desirable.</p>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">	The skills, qualifications and experience that I currently have:</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">The skills, qualifications and experience required for this position, that I believe I currently have are as follows, ability to develop and deliver training and/or speaking material for public and/or private events, solid communication skills to work with all stakeholders at various levels with firm but cooperative attitude, strong written skills to clearly explain concepts with accurate grammar, self-driven to progress work tasks in a timely manner, sometime autonomously, but under direction as required and flexibility and motivation to work.</p>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">How will I obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required?</H1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">First and foremost, to obtain “a degree in Technology or a relevant Business discipline or equivalent experience” I plan to finish the Bachelor of Information Technology course here at RMIT granting me one of these requirements that I do not have. To satisfy “Excellent technical knowledge and a minimum of 8 years’ experience in cybersecurity/penetration testing with a finger on emerging threats, vulnerability exploits and attack vectors” I will have to search for a job/ tertiary institute as to where I can obtain this experience. This experience can be had through applying and working for the Australian Defence Force, this will also give me another certification to work with security and highly classified information. Ability to develop web and infrastructure exploits for identified vulnerabilities can also be learnt though specific courses that RMIT offers such as Master of Cyber Security MC159, which includes opportunities for cyber security internships with industry organisations, both large and small, gaining more experience to apply for the position. To gain Industry certifications such as CREST, OSCP, OSCE, once adequate experience has been had, a candidate willing to obtain such certifications can apply to various websites such as “crest-approved.org, offensive-security.com and ranzcp.org” that supply exams and various courses that will ultimately certify an individual should the exam result be a pass.</p>
