	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">Ciao, mi chaimo Jarrod, ho 18 anni, oh sorry I was speaking Italian. Well basically what that says is that my name is Jarrod and that I am 18 years old. My student number is s3900062 and my student email is s3900062@rmit.student.edu.au, how unbelievable, like who could you have imagined that as my school email, right? I am from Italian and Mauritian backgrounds. Si vous ne le saviez pas déjà, c'est un petit pays au large de Madagascar, oh s#& I have done it again! What I was saying was that Mauritius is a small country off the coast of Madagascar. Mauritius is a Dutch founded, then French colonised country with various nationalities living there being of Indian and African backgrounds.</P>

	<P style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">I am tri-lingual, my first language is French, then learnt English as well as learnt Italian for all my primary and secondary schooling. I completed year 12 In the year 2020, although I did not get as high of an ATAR result as I wanted, I was quite satisfied with how I went overall due to such a messy and confusing year. An interesting fact about my self was that throughout the duration of my secondary schooling I ran a small business for building and selling custom built Gaming Computers for people who were inexperienced in building them, also teaching them how to build them if they wanted. I find building computers a very enjoyable and relaxing past time.</p>

	<P style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana"> Apart from being a tech nerd, I enjoy going playing football, soccer, table tennis and swims either on the beach or in pools. I enjoy thrills and going on long bike rides and doing dangerous stunts like jumping off ramps and man-made mountains with my bikes, my mates and I often go on large mountain biking trips, when we are not, we go for drives in the mountains. Whilst being a large tech nerd, I am big motor head! I love anything that has a motor, also my favourite car brand would be Holden or Holden Special Vehicles. I was gravely disappointed when General Motors Detroit announced that they were dropping Holden and everything to do with it. It genuinely brought a tear to my eye. The thought of me never being able to purchase a brand-new Commodore hurts, but I am glad that the car I currently own was a holden and that was purchased brand new, and I was the first to sit in it. Well, that is a bit about me and who I am. </p>
