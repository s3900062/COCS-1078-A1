<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">What is my intrest?</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">My interest in IT has been with hardware and software, for hardware I enjoy, as mentioned before, building computers. I am fascinated with how components work in unison (or sometime against each other). I also find the progress of computers and how they have evolved from the humble Intel 4004 with 2,250 transistors to today’s beast AMD Ryzen 9 5900X with a whopping 3,800 million transistors. Whilst the physical hardware of computers is fascinating, the software that runs on it is quite interesting too. I am blown away by how the software that has been developed can help people and that helps people in their everyday life. </p>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">When did my interest begin?</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">My interest in IT started a while ago, maybe in 2010. We had an old Compaq Desktop, and I started to tinker around with various operating systems like Windows Vista, Windows 7 and learning about how components work and what their purposes are. I also dabbled with Virtual machines and their limitations. This sparked an interest with computers and from then on, I found myself picking up old computers and fixing them, taking them apart and learning about how all the hardware works. Another large influence was my father, since he worked largely to do with circuits and electrical items such as fans and lights, I was already more guided to the hardware side of IT. Since I feel knowledgeable to do with the physical side of computers, I wanted to learn about the software side. I have also worked for a company called GS1 (year 10 work placement) which taught me network topology as well as the management of various user’s accounts stored on a centralised server. </p>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">Why did I choose RMIT?</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">I chose to study here at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology as I had done some research on the courses available and from reviews from past students, I found that the selection of courses and the teaching method suited well with my learning habits as well as offered the career paths that stood out to me. The courses at RMIT set me up well for the career choice I wish to pursue, being Cyber Security. </p>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">What do I expect to learn?</h1>	
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">During my studies, I expect to learn about Information Technology, history of computers, broaden my understanding with software. My courses teach me how to manage databases, coding in python and the way to improve user experience through choices influenced by UX professionals. I hope to gain useful knowledge to do with cyber security as that is my intended outcome of finishing my tertiary education here at RMIT.</p>
