<h1>What is my intrest?</h1>
<p>My interest in IT has been with hardware and software, for hardware I enjoy, as mentioned before, building computers. I am fascinated with how components work in unison (or sometime against each other). I also find the progress of computers and how they have evolved from the humble Intel 4004 with 2,250 transistors to todayâ€™s beast AMD Ryzen 9 5900X with a whopping 3,800 million transistors. Whilst the physical hardware of computers is fascinating, the software that runs on it is quite interesting too. I am blown away by how the software that has been developed can help people and that helps people in their everyday life. </p>
