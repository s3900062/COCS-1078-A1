<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">Overview</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">For my project idea, I aim to create an application for primary students that aims to inform them about various hardware components inside computers and how they interact with Operating systems. The application will be interactive and have various game sections so that pupils that can enjoy learning about how all parts of a computer, laptop, smartphone and other forms of device work. Included in this application will also be images as well as explanations of each component withing the application so the pupils will learn how these components work together and their purpose inside any modern piece of technology. </P>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">Motivation</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">I believe that it is important for kids to learn about how and what makes their tech work, so they can gain an understanding and appreciation for modern innovation. Computers have become vastly available throughout the western world and has had a massive effect on the development of children. (Typekids.com, 2010, How do computers influence children’s development?). As kids are becoming more proficient in technology from younger ages, I believe that it is fundamental for budding hardware and software engineers become acquainted with the fundamental components within a device and understand the important roll that each serves in the device. Devices often break, the estimated cost of a computer repair specialist ranges from $85 to $143, with the median cost ranging from $90 to $121 across Australia (oneflare group,2021, How much do Computer Repairs cost?) I believe that teaching kids from young ages about common hardware faults and ways to fix that could save them a lot of money in the long run, teach them about how delicate computers can be and even in the future allow them to come up with ideas on improving hardware to never have these faults. I am to facilitate the lack of knowledge and resources through an interactive app that thus informs them of faults, common issues as well as information of hardware.</P>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">Description</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">The program I aim to create will be an interactive from based program that will have the ability to run on various operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OSX/ iOS, Android and Linux or other distros of Linux, that will also be a portable executable with internet access to specialise lesson plans tailored to each pupil by providing a unique login to each student. My program will have 3 main topics being covered, 1. Covering the basic components of computers (e.g., HDD, CPU, RAM etc), 2. Errors and faults that occur and how to fix them (common crashes, ram faults etc) and 3. How operating systems interact with components. Each topic will have a set of features being, interactive learning games, images with descriptions, videos and self-tests that will evaluate the learning of the pupils once they have mastered a specific topic. Interactive learning games will be a mix of visual prompts such as images, text as well as sounds. By having the tasks interactive it will stimulate and engage the pupil whilst they are learning so that they can enjoy the activity and gain more knowledge from the activity, the interactive games will involve pupils clicking/ moving photos around, moving text to match up with the component and to answer small questions about specifics of the course. Images with descriptions is the more common way of learning, by presenting the pupil with an image of the component, the jobs it typically does and how it works within a system, the pupil would be able to visualise the component and understand what it does within a system, the user can click components of a device and a description of that component will appear informing them of the tasks and purposes of that component. The application will use videos to show pupils where these components are found in common devices, errors that these components often experience as well as how to diagnose them or solve the problem that are common. Self-tests are interactive forms that could have a mix of videos, text, images as well as interactive components to the form. These forms will test the knowledge of the pupils after a lesson, they will provide a percentage grade that will determine if they have learnt the content of the course. The form will also provide a list of content that was either wrong or that was missed, this will help pupils identify where they are making mistakes. If there is constant mistakes, or reoccurring mistakes, the application will create a personalised study plan so that the student can improve in the areas that are confusing them or the content that is hard to understand. The program will also include a teacher’s section that will provide suggested physical lesson plans such as “building a computer” as an example. This will inform teachers of the visual prompts as well as thinks they can buy to provide a hands on experience as well as further the learning of the students that will use the application.</P>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">Tools and Technologies</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">The software required to bring this project idea into fruition is any type of software that has the ability to create, run and test code in, some commons are visual studio, notepad ++ and GIT. There can be use from open-source coding websites such as stacks overflow and w3schools or  coding tutorials from youtube.com. As there is no specific set of required hardware, any device that has the ability to run, create and execute code should suffice in the creation of this project. This is up to the developer to select a machine with the Operating system most suited to them also whatever language they choose to program in, to have the required software to be able to create the application. </P>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">Skills Required</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">The skills required for this project is to have an in-depth knowledge, understanding and appreciation for components within any technological device, to be able to identify the name and state what each component does within a device and how it is used in conjunction with an operating system. A knowledge of operating systems and the tasks they complete. An understanding of graphical user interfaces as well as how people interact with GUI design choices. Being proficient in a programming language in order to create a program. Finding the skills of someone who is knowledgeable about hardware will not be difficult as I believe that I would be able to cover mostly all the basics, however for the more in-depth knowledge, I believe finding a qualified technician with in-depth knowledge won’t be difficult to obtain. For the programming, a language such as visual studio can be used, and, since throughout my secondary schooling I had learnt the language, I believe that I would be able to code the application. </P>
<h1 style="font-size:2vw; font-family:verdana">Outcome</h1>
	<p style="font-size:1.5vw; font-family:verdana">If this product were to be successful, the outcome will be that any school or entity that employs my application will have students that know the insides of a computer, the ability to name and state the functions of hardware inside a computer, will be equipped with the basic knowledge of how do diagnose as well as solve errors that arise with hardware, the ability to build a computer and have a good understanding of operating systems. The original problem of inexperience to do with hardware will be solved as now from a younger age kids will be exposed to the inner workings of devices and theoretically be able to understand and repair their own devices. </P>
